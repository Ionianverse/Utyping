Cells are the tiny units that make up all living things, from the smallest bacteria to the largest animals. Each cell works like a miniature factory, producing energy and carrying out vital functions.
The human body contains hundreds of bones and trillions of cells, all working together to keep us healthy. Our heartbeat, breathing, and movements are powered by amazing biological systems.
