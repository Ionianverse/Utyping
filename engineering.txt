Engineers design bridges, buildings, and vehicles that connect and move the world. Every structure is carefully planned, tested, and built to solve real-life problems and improve quality of life.
A simple lever or pulley can greatly multiply a person's strength. From ancient times to today, engineers use creative ideas to build tools and machines that make our lives easier.
Structural engineers design buildings to withstand loads such as wind and earthquakes.
Civil engineering involves the design and construction of infrastructure like roads and bridges.
Thermodynamics is essential for understanding energy transfer in mechanical systems.
Electrical circuits control the flow of electrons to power devices and machines.
Robotics combines mechanical design with electronics and programming to automate tasks.
Materials science studies the properties of metals, polymers, and composites.
Software engineering focuses on developing reliable and maintainable computer programs.
Hydraulic systems use pressurized fluid to transmit power in heavy equipment.
Control systems maintain stability and desired performance in dynamic machines.
Environmental engineering aims to reduce pollution and protect natural resources.
